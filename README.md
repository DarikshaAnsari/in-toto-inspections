# in-toto inspections

[in-toto](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto#layout) has the concept of *inspections*. Inspections are defined in a software supply chain layout and consist of a command to be run during the in-toto verification process and optionally artifact rules.

This repo provides a collection of commonly used inspection commands to be shipped out or plugged-in with in-toto.
